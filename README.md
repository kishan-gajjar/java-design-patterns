# strategy-pattern

Strategy pattern is based on three design principle:

#1 Identify the aspects of your code that vary and separate them from what stays the same <br />
#2 Program to an interface, not an implementation  <br />
#3 Favor Composition over Inheritance

This pattern define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it. A class behavior or its algorithm can be changed at run time
